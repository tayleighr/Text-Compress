# Text-Compress
This implementation is used to compress local ascii text files. 

It utilizes a BST structure to build a huffman tree based on file character frequency. Very frequent characters are encoded with fewer binary digits, reducing the number of bits required to store the text.

I'm using the project to learn more about OOD in C++, with special focus on std objects and smart pointers. I did a lot of experimenting and focused more on trying new things than choosing the most straight forward methods in places. It was a good time.
